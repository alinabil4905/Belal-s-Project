### Libraries Used
- [Architecture][1] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
 - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Architecture Components provides ViewModel helper class for the UI controller that is responsible for preparing data for the UI,ViewModel objects are automatically retained during configuration changes so that data they hold is immediately available to the next activity or fragment 
* [Data Binding][2] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
* [Lifecycles][3] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
* [LiveData][4] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
* [Navigation][5] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
* [Room Database][6] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
* [ViewModel][7] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* [UI][9] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Animations & Transitions][10] - Move widgets and transition between screens.
  * [Fragment][11] - A basic unit of composable UI.
